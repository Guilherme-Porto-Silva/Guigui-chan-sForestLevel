                    Level 607 is the 608th level of the Backrooms and takes the apearence of a liminal and sparce forest, of wich the sky is permanetly filled with clunds that sofer no change when water comes down from them, reason why some people believe they are not the source of the very soft rains that begin aperently at random and tend to last for a day. Seemingly never ending stone-made path ways cut trough that forest, sorounded by metal-made handrails that are too far from the ground to actualy prevent a person from going out of the path way if they want to, wich is needed to grab the level exclusive item but should not be done by those who don't have that porpouse due to level exclusive entitys that lurk beiong them. Blue plastic-made retangles can be found sometimes, close enough to the path way for people to trough trash into them without crossing the handrails, they should be avoided by those who see them shaking or jumping, as it probably means a level exclusive entity is hidding inside them.

                    The Chocolate Nuts are beens found on tree logs all around level 607, making it look like they have some kind of desise similar to variola or something like that. They smell like cocoa and relise stuff if leaved inside boiling water while it unboils, there for turning it similar to chocolate milk. While the beens themselves remind MMS with the taste of  chocolate and don't do much when eaten, the milk-like mixture they make can be sweeter than actuall chocolate milk and triggers the same effects as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matcha flavored lucky'O milk</a>, more eficiently than it.

                    "Spider Flyes" are strange spider and flye combination, and even have a little from scorpions. They inject eggs into humans who get near them, from wich grow grose creatures called "Shadowormlings" due to their shape and color. As Spider Flyes tend to pack on the people, their victims use to get entirely field of Shadowormlings, who steal all components from their bodys while growing. Spider Flyes are not venomus, but the Shadowormling eggs act as poison in practice, also they wish to inject them in humans regardless of hunger and fear. Spider Flyes never build webs like regular spiders, insted, they make trees into hauses by damaging their logs with their claws, wich becomes possible by there being so many individuals working together.

                    <p>
                        "Dragonfighters" are they grown up versions of the Shadowormlings that have successfully consumed humans as much as they needed in orther to evolve. Now, as adults, they still consume the people found by them in the level even if they did not cross the metal-made handrails, the diference is that they use their mouths this time. And they only atack when hungry, allowing even to be petted when calm, so, a good information for us there. Trough away <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greasy Marshmallows</a> and they are runnig twords it and leaving you alone for a moment, Dragonfighters realy love that food. It is actually possible for one to begin acting nicely twords you and defending you from other entitys and humans, if the individual believes you are feeding them Greasy Marshmallows more in the future. This relationship is only lasting if you keep feeding Greasy Marshmallows to the Dragonfighter, so, make sure to visit the kichen area of <i class="gray">Level -599</i> if you want not to be betrailed. Some people actually put molten Greasy Marshmallows in dog bows for their Dragonfighter to eat, like if it was water or milk. Just like their larva versions, the Shadowormlings, Dragonfighters have pich-color skin, the diference is that white fur that grows on their hads and midle areas, wich is assumed to reduce heat loss. Dragonfighters have that thing on their heads, it is an eletromagnetic wave reciver, that allows them to fell when redios are used nearby and track the source of their waves, in order to find and eat people. There is also that dark blue tale with a bat shape, it senses changes in the air behind the Dragonfighter, like sound waves or dashes.

                <p>
                    There is also an extreamely agressive creature, like, to the point of it being a very hard quest to photograph it properly, that being the reason why a few M.E.G. oficers atempted drowing it on a board. The creature refered to as "Nature Blob" concists on two fleshy cocuns that apear to be shoved into eachother, with a hole in their middle opening itself when the entity detects movement, presumebly due to the vibration of its fleshy and moist material. Though being white at the drowing, the entity's skin is actually moss-color smooth green, and red lines pop a milimiter (mm) out of it. This hole's inside is dark red and from it is projectiled acid, dodging sad projectile tends to result on trees behind the dodger being desolved, though only their subers are. The creature does not have eyes, it is just two moist meat balls tite to eachother, it can easely be confused with a plant.
